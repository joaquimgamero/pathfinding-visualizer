<h2>Pick any algorithm you like</h2>
<p>
    You can use the algorithm picker to try different algorithms. Note that some algorithms are
    <strong>unweighted</strong>, while others
    are <strong>weighted</strong>. Unweighted algorithms do not take turns or weight nodes into account, whereas
    weighted ones do.
